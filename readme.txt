i want that round metal thing

i calculate how much RAM (aka RSS) a process or group of processes (browser, database) uses, i solve "shared memory multiple times" problem of standard programs
i use /proc/processid/pagemap to connect frames (physical memory segments)  with pages (virtual memory segments), and then filter them, leaving only unique and present (not swapped out)
